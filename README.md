This code is just for practicing preprocessing in NLP.

In this lab, we will be exploring how to preprocess tweets for sentiment analysis. 
We will provide a function for preprocessing tweets during this week's assignment, but it is still good to know what is going on under the hood. 
By the end of this, you will see how to use the NLTK package to perform a preprocessing pipeline for Twitter datasets.

To help with that, we will be using the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) package, an open-source Python library for natural language processing. 
It has modules for collecting, handling, and processing Twitter data, and you will be acquainted with them as we move along the course.

For this exercise, we will use a Twitter dataset that comes with NLTK. This dataset has been manually annotated and serves to establish baselines for models quickly.
